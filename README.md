## __USGS Earthquake Data Visualization__

__Background__

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) is dedicated to providing scientific insights about natural hazards, ecosystems, and the Earth's dynamics. They collect extensive earthquake data globally but lack an effective way to visualize and communicate this information. This project aims to develop visualization tools to aid in educating the public and government organizations about critical planetary issues.


## __Creating the Earthquake Visualization__


* Retrieved data by visiting the USGS GeoJSON Feed and selected a dataset (e.g., "All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days").

* Used Leaflet to create a map plotting earthquake locations based on latitude and longitude.

* Marker size represents earthquake magnitude, and color reflects depth.

* Includes popups displaying additional earthquake information.

* Created a legend providing context for map data.
